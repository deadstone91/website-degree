  <h2>week1 - understanding the context of use</h2>
  <h4>identify methods</h4>
  <p>The methods that I choose to use to identify users of my chosen app is observation, and interviews into the use of the system. I made these choices because observing someone use a bad version of an application can show us what issues thet could be facing. I also thought that interviews would be good for the fact that you can get the persons feeling on what is good and bad about something afterwards.</p>
  <h4>Carrying Out Methods</h4>
  <p>The first method is obervation. I will observe a user trying to find books about web design in the college online library search on the college REMS system. After observing the use of it, the context it would be used in would be if we were checking (1) if the book exists in the library (2) and if it does exist the next step is to see if it already revserved or not. It was observed that they library worked correctly. <br> Method two is Interview. From the interview the user obverved:<br>
  - The design is not fluid or intuitive. <br>
  - The information is not set out logically to know what is what<br>
  - Example of this was given with where the reserve button is placed, at end of the page of a book the user wants to reserve. it would have been advantagous the button- or second button up by the book.
  -the user was impressed by the search bar which if a name of an author was entered would display all names similar to the name used. 
  </p>
  <h4>Persona of user of library</h4>
  <img class="img-fluid" src="\model\media\College-Student-938x535.jpg" alt="college/uni student">
  <pre>
  Name: Nigel treger
  Age: 20
  occupation: Student - Physiology
  Marital Stasis: single
  Interests: Gaming, reading and  playing Poker for fun. 
  Concerns: Plastic waste, aging Grandparents</pre>
  <h4>Context of use and persona explination</h4>
  <p>The context of use of an app created for finding and reserving books. This application use is very spicific for the fact that it is only for those who attend the college and have sign in details for the college systems. This application does not have a specified place of use, it can be used anywhere at anytime to reserve a book or journal for the users studies. The persona i created, i thought would be an example of the average user of the library. Obviously the first thing to realise with any personas created is that they have to be students or employees of the college. I decided that my persona would be a student. I chose that he be a student of Physiology for the reason that i expect that to be a course that would need books and journals for learning. Other information about him was just generic but because he was young i decided that like many he might be concerned about the welfare of the world he will live in, because of this i created him with a concern of plastic waste.  </p>

    <h1>Week 2 - Context of use</h1>
    <h4>Choice of application</h4>
    <p>I have choosen to develop the library application.
      <br><br>
      LIBRARY CATALOGUE
<br>
Abertay has a large selection of books available for students. However locating books using the online SUMMONS system can be a challenge.
<br><br>
Is there a more user friendly way that students could search for a book they need and reserve it?</p>
<h4>Reflect on the application</h4>
<p>Of any of the applications to choose in this coursework i think that the library one may be the most difficult, why?  Simply, trying to do something that is always implimented in the same fashion and change how it is displayed and done is not an easy task.<br><br>
  <strong>Features</strong><br>
  The aspect that would be the main feature of the application is a search function, I expect this to be the central point where the eyes will focus.<br> An extention of the aforementioned feature would be the ability to filter the search to find books by type or subject, or for those weird people a random book button. <br> Another function that the app will have is a section with a list of current books taken out and reserved books it may also have a history section of previously taken out books. Last feature i consider of import, i am studying at fife college i would like the application to also be able to switch between campus libraries and display books by how many is at each campus. Added to this is the ability to reserve a book at a specific campus. I am thinking that it could have a review section where-in users can obviously review the book(s).
<br><strong>Weeks Review</strong><br>
From what i have read from the lecture notes from this week is the for an application time changes how something should be implimented. Example in the notes was hospital notes and how it used to be written on a computer in a central area of the ward, but time and technology meant that mobile computers made things easier. The same is with the library, at one time people would reserve from an inhouse computer, but time allows this to be a mobile reserving service because of the internet and mobile devices. The users would probabily want to reserve a book while studing at home or even while in class.<br>

<br><strong>Lab Paper 1</strong><br>
<p>
The lab paper was written to discuss the thoughts of involving users of a product more in the discussion and design process. The reason for this is to see id there is more commercial benefit in involving the user more. It has been seen that a lot of older people don’t engage well with technology because often they aren’t taken into consideration through the design process of products. 2008 more people were over the age of 60 than were under the age of 18. While it is the case, that users are often in the discussions of design, in point 3 of the case study, in the design of wheelchairs users, paralympians were considered in the design process and this is great. Issue being that as much as their input would of made a difference, it didn’t take into consideration those who were less able bodied than the olympians.
In 3.3 focuses what comes first in perceptions, it was noticed that aesthetics often came ahead of functionality, and that functionality should not highlight the users personal disability. there seems to be positive want of empowerment. So new functionality, should look good. This was bourne out by the fact the users would prefer to use something that didn’t work for them fully if it seems to look better for them. Section 4.3 mentions that in the design of a supermarket often the older generation isn’t taken into consideration.
What i take from this lab paper is to be considerate of more than the stereotypical users of what the app would provide. the persona that i created felt like someone i thought the app would be perfect for, the issues being that many others would be likely to use, for example a single man might find it very useful. Another thing would be the size of buttons and the size to text to make sure that those of all ages and generations would have the ability to use it without problems.

<h1>Week 3 </h1>
<strong>Lab 2</strong><br>
<p> The lab paper to be looked at for this week was a study of advantages or disadvantages of using concurrent think aloud (CTA) verses retrospective think aloud (RTA). This study was done taken with doctors who work in an ICU environment. They used a complex query program to find data on issues faced with patients. CTA has its limitations in the fact that it could slow the working process of those doing the job while they verbally say what they are doing. RTA in this instance was used with the users tasks recorded and then later asked to discuss them and why and what they were doing. The test subjects 8 of which were experienced users and 8 others that were new users to the platform. Six tasks were given them all to do. The analysis of the outcome is very complex. However, the main analysis from our point of view is what was better, CTA or RTA. From the reading of the results CTA seemed to pick up more issues that what RTA did. CTA found more issues with navigation, symbols, error messages, information organisation and ease of use. RTA highlighted system terminology that was unclear but also helped in highlighting options for new functions that could be added. CTA seems to be better in finding issues which using the program but RTA is better for finding about usability and redesign ideas. They concluded that if one were to be done CTA is by far the better and that RTA needed more research into.</p><strong>weekly task 2</strong><br><p>The lesson this week highlighted the fact that we as the designers of an application must make sure that we truly know who the users are for the project. The most common issues with projects are caused because the requirements are not clearly defined at the beginning of the project. We must make sure we can define as many of the functional and non-functional requirements as possible to make sure the app is correct for the user.</p><br>
<strong>Application Context of use</strong>
<p>The context of the application is for the user can while not at a college library request a book for there own use. This means that the context of where it is used can be anywhere but i would expect it would be at times when the user might want to know if there is a book in stock so they can go and get it. So even if they could use this app anywhere i think while in the college might be the greatest time they would use the application</p><br>

<strong>Assignment 2 - requirement gathering</strong><br>
<p>1. For this section i think that i will use Observation of the user and a Questionaire.<br><strong>Materials Preperation - Questionnaire i will use </strong><br>
<img class="img-fluid"src="\model\media\Questionnaire-library page.jpg" alt="Questionnaire"><br>
<strong>requirements</strong><br>
<pre>
functional requirements:
    Display list of books
    display book information
    allow user to reserve book(s)
    allow cancelation of reservation
    allow user to sign-in.
    be conected to a data service. 
    display how many books are aviable of reserved of a books
    list of books you have reserved or have reserved in the past.

non-functional requirements:
    Must update books in real time.
    Should keep your login details secure.
    Should be easy to use
    should be obvious on how it works.

</pre>
<strong>Assignment 2 - Design Scope </strong><br>
The application must make sure it complys to GDPR and data protection rules. With data protection the designer must make sure that only data that is needed for use on the application should be kept. Once some of this information is no longer needed, it should be destroyed. I don’t think i can think of any major technical issues that may have to be overcome by the software engineer except maybe making sure the database connection is stable. One way he could overcome this is maybe by allowing offline use until a connection is made. Then the application all send all the data in one lump send. But concerning reservation it will not allow these if the database is not connected.

<h1>Week 4</h1>
<strong>Lab 3</strong>
<p>This weeks lab paper looks at the difficulties of design while trying to conform to regulation. both regulator and designers don’t have much interaction while a product is being made. The aspect focused on is the use of privacy in the world of designing Internet of things(IoT) devices.

With the possibility of 24 billion IoT devices being in circulation in 2019, privacy can be a concern. Often these devices being in private settings, could present privacy issues that could allow hackers into your home. Also shows concerns in the use of data, according to the lab paper 70% of users asked, thought that they should be asked first if data was to be send to the product maker. It is noted that this should extend beyond just data protection but also the dignity of those who are using the IoT devices. This causes moral issues in the fact that if privacy is built into the design, does this allow the user to choose what regulations they want and do not want to follow. Regulations are becoming fragmented, often the designers seen to be the regulators, this adds the question, of who is responsible if something goes wrong.  HCI can be used to help understand the life people live and how devices will interact with them and change their lives. This means for me making sure that whatever i make for a client, has to be safe for their use but also fit into the needs of their everyday. The article goes onto talk about the idea of taking the values of the consumer into account. I totally agree, but think the issues with this is the variety of values that consumers have, but at least taking an average of values could help a product impact the consumer more that just how the user would interact with it. The article suggested using value sensitive design (VSD) which was a good call but asks the all important question, whose values are being implanted into the design of the product. The ideals for perfect regulation is becoming more difficult when we now interact with tech differently that in the past, so agreeing with this paper there needs to be changes to keep up with the changing times.<br><br>

I have taken the results from the Questionnaires and observation to design my lo-fi Prototypes. From these results we see that the college liabray page is not well organised esspecially for first time users of it. It also doesnt have a professional design. To this end i tried to think of a design that was obvious and you knew what everthing did yet having a professional design.

<h1>Week 5</h1>
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<p>
  Form the lecture of this week we really learn how important prototyping is. It helps the developer get over thoughts and ideas to the client. There is great logic in this, if we went straight to the client with the final design for deployment there would be a great chance that there would be many things that they would want to change and dislike. Prototyping means that we can go to the client with ideas, that with progressive prototypes can refine what the final product will look like. This provides peace of mind for the client whom wants to be happy with what he is getting.
</p>
<strong>lab Paper 4</strong><br>
<p>
In the thoughts of HCI rarely does the emotions of the researchers get taken into account. This obviously could have an impact on how they research and even the validity of it. It seems to be that the social sciences are more open to discussing how research has affected them, but with those involved in Stem research are less open to talking about their feelings. Those who were researched for the paper worked with tech for end of life use. They often had extended times of crying, guilt and nightmares and on occasion distress. Most institutions never considered that research could be damaging to those researching. It was found that fore-knowledge of what they might face with this research was a good thing. Often discussion was a help for them, either with peers or professional counselors. because of the sensitive nature of the research often the users didn’t talk to family of friends on the subject affecting them. Often found was these emotions were good to help those who were in need but not the researchers themselves.

I personally read recently a story about the lack of support for those in social media moderation.  Hundreds if not thousands of people are employed to look at or watch posts that are deemed against the networks guidelines. Examples were given of them watching, rape, child pornography and murder to name just a few so as to moderate the internet. Many of them were emotional scarred from doing this job, and support was severally lacking.

<h4>Client(classmates) - feelings of lo-fi ideas</h4>
<p>
    <pre>
    Euan 

    HOME
    Randomly spaced out buttons hard to follow with the eyes.
    Material design buttons more understanding to majority of users, though the fife college logo set would provide similar feel over the whole college infrastructure. 
    Having a sign in modal doesnt feel correct, thinks it be better as a seperate activity that then goes back to the home screen.
    OTHER SCREENS
    Likes the simple easy to follow design of other screens. 
    On results screen expects there to be a filter button for more refined results.
    
    
    James
    
    HOME
    Likes the non linear design - unique 
    Likes material design, unsure about triangle fife logo idea buttons
    SEARCH
    Not sure of back button position
    Simple and effective
    RESULTS
    Could be more concise, with just book cover and title.
    SINGLE RESULT

    What happen if they are not yet logged in
    HISTORY
    Happy with full design.
    </pre>
</p>
<p>I found the protptyping very difficult, the reason for this was its hard to create something new from i simple idea that has been done a miriad times before. A library application always looks similar because of the context of the design. The discussion with the clients(classmates) went very well, this is where you find out how peoples tastes and opinions differ on design. As seen it the results from above they both had differing opinions on the design idea of the home screen, this i think is where i really am unsure on what path to take in the future design because i dont know if i should keep the simple design or an out there design. I had read that one of the most effective ways of prototyping is that of paper sketch, i have prefered this way because it feels natural for me and it can take a while to get the hang of a computer program that helps you prototype when in a jiffy you can have something on paper that is worth something in the eyes of the client.</p>
<h4>lab paper 5</h4>
<p>New technologies have to start somewhere, often at the expense of time and logical procedure, this is seen it the contents of this white paper.<br>

  To me the advantages to this procedure seem great if the process was faster and with a cutting method that has been said has not been implemented into the system yet, it is obvious that the system itself is still in the prototype stage. Speaking about prototypes, i personally think that this system is by far too complex to do prototypes, this would be good for near complete models of soft toy objects. for a prototype which really shouldn’t be terribly advanced should just be felt with stuffing inserted. I think the same goes for adding electronics into the toys, this paper makes it seem really complex and difficult, but it been getting done for years in more traditional methods. Especially is this point seem when they started adding plastic strips/pins into the stuffing to get other things to catch to the felt did i feel that this could be a danger to those most likely to be using these stuffed like toys, young children. so, i feel, yes great advancement, but it needs a lot of work and research before it should be used for alpha phase released toys.</p>
<hr>
  <h1>WEEK 7 - FEEDBACK WEEK</h1>


  <p>This week we are asked to make a High fedelity Prototype. I took feedback from my discussions with with the clients on the low fedelity. From this i decided that the idea of using the triangle fife college logo was not a good idea and thought i would use the material design buttons. However, to be in keeping with the design i thought that i would make the buttons the colours that are used in the logo. Other changes i made was the removal of the sign-in button and created a profile button that replaces the advanced search button. I took this aproach because i realised it would be more logical to put the advanced search on the seach page. the profile button lead to a whole page for sign-in. Apart from this, everything else has basically stayed the same.<br>
  <h4>Evaluation Methods</h4>
  I will use a questionnaire again this time for the evaluation of the high fidelity prototype, i feel this is the best thing that i can do.

  </div><br>
<h4>Lab Paper 6</h4>
In this week’s paper we have a look at the differences between 2 different ways of testing a prototype. It is found that often getting prototype feedback from testing using the public can be expensive. So the paper takes 2 other possible testing methods.

Firstly, experience prototyping where the designers themselves test the product in real life scenarios. This had its disadvantages from the facts that they themselves knew how the application on the pda’s worked, and also bias. Often we can be biased with  something that we ourselves have made, especially if we fins issues with it, we could cope because it’s “ours”. The testing done with the tourist map had the limits that often it was because a landmark was on the device, not for the reason that the person actually was interested it that place.

Second, Wizard of oz prototyping is where mock versions are created but to the user feels like the real experience. To do this there was the need of “wizards”, some of the development team working behind the scene sending fake but real information to the handheld devices. This technique had its issues in the facts that the user often expected in to work better than it did and with the tourism map, to me it seemed nearly pointless as how little could be done using this testing method.

In my opinion, the first method seemed better, even though it did not use users who were not involved in the project, they got a feel of how it might or might not get used and this influenced what possible changes that would/could be made.
  <hr>
<h1>WEEK - 8 Evaluation</h1>
This weeks lecture felt a bit like a rehash of one that we had a few weeks back about evaluations of the low fidelity designs. Though i thought the section about observation compelling. The reason for this was because it is completely true that when observed there feels a pressure that you would not normally feel because 'someone is literarly looking over your shoulder'. It is amazing how different you do things when you are worried of the opinion of the observer. For that reason it is not something that i am doing. When getting the questionnaire filled out i will not be in the room for the users opinions.

<h4> Evaluation Results - maybe put in wrong week</h4>
<img src="\model\media\hifi-questionnaire Euan.JPG" alt="Euan results"><br><br>
I readly admit that i don't have two results here, one of my participants decided not to give me my results back. <br><br>
From the evaluation information that i have been given from Euan, he has been critical of a few of the page designs. I value his opinion and because of this if i was to take this design and develop it i would consider changing a few things. The main changes would be to split the history page into 2 or three pages to give more information in a clean and uncramped format. I know from the previous evaluation of the lo-fi designs that he didnt like the home page idea, but i kept it for reason that i wanted something different to more standard boring designs. Though i am sure the client will be happy i didnt go with the logo design triangle buttons, as am i.

<hr>
<h1>WEEK 9 - PRACTICAL EVALUATION</h1>

Honestly, what could i have done differently, well for one thing i could of passed this module the first time. Because i didn’t, this makes a few difficulties with evaluations because i am "rushing" the resit. From what i remeber, being a participant was interesting because it is always fun to see what someone does as the design, especially when considered against what we ourselves might design. Another difficulty with doing something like this with those you know it that you can be scared to give your opinion about how you feel about there designs because they are "Friends". <br>
This evaluation differs in the fact that this time the clients have opinions of a final design idea rather than a very basic design idea that was before. This is where we hope that the design is actually a good idea.



<h4>Lab paper 8</h4> 
the lab paper for this week focuses on a trend called the evaluator effect. This seems to be where with the use of multiple evaluators sometimes with differing degrees of training in usability testing can have an adverse effect to the results of the test itself. What comes as an issue is what the evaluator decides shows that the test subject is struggling with usability.

The evaluators were to evaluate testing done by users using a haulage website.

Section 4.3 of the document was interesting for the fact we get to know how the evaluators themselves felt about the problems found. we see clearly that every one evaluates differently and this is an issue in finding true results for problems on the site.

The document says that “Less severe problems contributed more to this evaluator effect than severe problems”. I personally can understand this for the fact that a “serious” issue should be clearly seen by all or most who are evaluating the data.

It is of interest that it mentions that the evaluators dont often know anything special about the domains that are being tested especially concerning e-commerce. it is seen throughout this study that this had in impact on the variety of the different issue found throughout this study. I agree completely that knowledge of what the test subjects are using is necessary and that if evaluation of this sort is done it should be done by multiple evaluators to find more issues than what just one would do.

        I am throughly confused, both the first sample and second come to 0, because the mean values cancel each other out and can't devide by 0. I can't figure out this issue. but i have tried to show working so that i have not put anything in for this section of the blog.

        Commenting to the lecture for these weeks, i totally do not understand statistics. i know means and that type of thing but other tests of find out subtle differences has made my brain hurt and the data above just confused me even more...<br><br>
  
<h4>Lab paper 10</h4>
Every website with the ability to store user sign in data will have the ability to recover password if the user has forgotten their data. <br>

The use of using recovery questions is not secure at all. The document mentions that  a large proportion of the questions answers can be found in the public domain, and if not can be guessed within a short amount of times. Another type is out-of-band communications (i had never heard of this before, but have used it) is where a code or something is send to a mobile device used for verification. This is good and all but according to the white paper around 60% of us do not lock our mobile devices. <br>

This paper focuses on QR code, one time recovery and also on trusted friend. What i found very interesting from this paper is the reveals from the test subjects about these. Most of them found the QR code not be be a secure as the trusted friend. What though was a surprise was that because the QR code was faster to use as recovery it was the choice of most of the test subjects. I personally think i prefer the trusted friend because its more secure i feel than having a “code” lying around.
