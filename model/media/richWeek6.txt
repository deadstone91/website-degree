This weeks blog is designed around augularJS. <br>

For the first time looking at Angular i thought it to look dreadfully daunting. The extra sections in the html code definately confused me. However, once i had a read of what it was and in basc form how it worked i could see some basis for its use. If it has anything going for it, it is that it seems to simplfy the need for lots of js code if one were to write large js files. I do disagree in the point of it being simple, i found it hard to pick up and understand,for the reason being that the way it is written at times seems so different to standard coding ideas that i personally am used to. But i expect that if i kept using it i would pick it up with ease, similair to how i managed to figure the basics of jquery, though i think i will still find jQuery easier to use. One of the things i do like about angular is the idea of having variable built into html. I have to say though i do like it.<br>
Thinking about the task of making a simple angular application that used php to get data from mysql, i have techically magaged to get it working exceptfor the fact that for some reason the ng-repeat does not display the data to the screen, i though have designed it so that it alerts the data out to see that the data has actually been returned from the server to the angular. I have also dispalyed the data in a paragraph tag so that at least it is dispalyed. From what i can deduct from what i have looked into the file w3 uses gives all the json a name "records". Without this on my json it seems to break, but somehow i cant figure out how to sort it from standpoint of the php data.<br><br>Here is the webpage to see it. - https://livingstone.me/view/angular.html <br>
