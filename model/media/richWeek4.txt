On the first week of this blog i created my RIA. Being that i didnt read ahead of time i didnt consider using jquery ajax, i used traditional js ajax, which for the purpose that it is needed works find, justs looks cumbersome.<br><br> To save on lines of code on my website i used php to create the 12 nav buttons that i need for my blog. At this point i add the week number to the function call from the onclick of the html. Each time that i click a button on the navbar it sends an xmlHttpRequest to get the data of id, title, blog data, and time made from my mySql database on my web server. This request returns this data in Json format. which i split into an assoc array and then display data to the screen.
