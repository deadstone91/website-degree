Jquery mobile<br><br>
One this we are told while doing this course is to try and do critical writing. Well here goes a stab at that.<br>
Jquery mobile, from what i can see is a great idea, a mobile designed web develoment framework, especially focused on the look and feel of it. <br> Issues is that new technologies have pushed through that have given other avenues for doing similair ideas, from my ideas i look at something like bootstrap that allows for designs to work on mobile and full width screens (jqm looks terrible on desktop). Another and probabily more substantial issue is support. According to github there has been no real updates to the jqm package for many years, things have moved on majorly since. For these reasons, there is no point in learning such an aged and depricated system. For this and the reason that we did some jqm stuff last semester i feel that this weeks stuff is pointless.
